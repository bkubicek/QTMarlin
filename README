This will soon be a QT tool for the marlin firmware.

intended features:
 Temp monitoring+PID adjustments,
 find accurate accelerations/velocities
 eeprom values managing
 configuration.h and pins.h creation.

external requirements:
-QT5
-QWT v6 (see below how to install)


To build, you have to adopt the qtmarlin.pro to have the correct dependency path for QWT.
then qmake or simply run it in QtCreator




Install QWT on macOS:

-Download the .tar.bz2 from here http://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt/files/qwt/6.1.0/
-Extract it where you want, for Example inside your Download-Folder
-Then change into the directory qwt-6.1.0
-Then you have to locate the qmake command line tool ( you can do so by simply searchng for it inside the Finder.
-Then qmake the qwt.pro File like /Applications/QT/5.1.0/clang_64/bin/qmake qwt.pro
-make
-sudo make install
-Inside your QT Project you have to add the following line to the .pro File include ( /usr/local/qwt-6.1.0/features/qwt.prf ) includes QWT libary into Project
-Now you have to create a softlink like this : sudo ln -s /usr/local/qwt-6.1.0/lib/qwt.framework/qwt /usr/lib/qwt
Thats it. QWT now should work.

UNDER MAVERICKS or later the last step does not work, do the following instead:

If you are using Mavericks you have to manually copy the qwt.framework to Libary/Frameworks folder for not getting the "dyld: Library not loaded: libqwt.6.dylib" error
